# Microdata Example -  Organization with departments, sub-departments contacts. Persons as a contact points per each department 
## Bootstrap 3 panel with Microdata

Made on Bootstrap 3.3.7 and validated with Google microdata validation tool. 

In this example I tried to show how you can layout contact list with BS3 and wrapped with microdata attributes.

## Files
A few words file naming, including and prefixing

### Naming files
Name fies abstract:
 * listing

 * ...

Prefix files with "_"

### Including files 
Include files in: 
 * top of the target if you wnat to cascade over the included syles (extend, modify, set state) and even override.
 * bottom of the target if you have cascades and overrides in the included files

## Comments
